# Statistics Basics üìà

This repository serves as a personal notebook and code collection for fundamental concepts in statistics and data analysis. The goal is to provide simple, practical examples and explanations for core statistical topics using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## üìö Topics Covered

- **Mean, Median, and Mode**: Understanding measures of central tendency.
- **Data Distributions**: Exploring common distributions and visualizing them with histograms.
- **Distribution Moments**: Analyzing the shape of distributions (skewness and kurtosis).
- **Standard Deviation and Variance**: Measuring the spread of data.
- **Covariance and Correlation**: Understanding the relationship between two variables.
- **Conditional Probability**: The probability of an event given that another event has occurred, with real-world business examples.
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Updating beliefs about probability based on new evidence, using a classic medical diagnosis example.

## üíª Code and Tools

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Each topic is covered in a separate `.ipynb` file, containing code, visualizations, and explanations.
- **Python Libraries**:
    - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
    - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
    - **Matplotlib**: For creating basic static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
    - **Seaborn**: For creating more advanced and aesthetically pleasing statistical charts.

## üìä Visualizations

The notebooks include various plots to help illustrate the concepts, such as:
- Histograms for data distributions.
- Bar charts for probability comparisons.
- Scatter plots for covariance and correlation.
